# Git Intro Challenge

## Git
The most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. A huge number of commercial and open source software projects rely on Git for version control.

Imagine making an update to your app, only to realise the update isn't needed. You've modified a dozen files and wish you could go back in time. Git makes this easy! With a single command you jump back to a previous version of your code.

The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time. Git stores this information a 'repository'.

One common criticism of Git is that it can be difficult to learn. We'll introduce git concepts gradually and by the end of the course it will feel like second nature.

## GitHub
Git is really useful for teamwork. You can 'push' your git repository to remote locations. This allows other team members to work on the same code. It also acts as a backup.

GitHub is one of the most popular places to store git repositories. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a web based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features.

You can refer to the  [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V56BTICBn1_nL9O3yGOJfgOg-gnHDwUb8CFB3eCDCt4/edit?usp=sharing "Git Intro Presentation") we covered in class
